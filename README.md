Binary sentiment analysis using news headlines to detect sarcasm in a sentence.
Training accuracy was close to 97% (some overfitting detected) and validation accuracy reached 81% in 30 epochs.

The vecs.tsv file and meta.tsv file can be used to visualise the word embeddings. We can use the Embedding Projector by tensorflow which is available at https://projector.tensorflow.org/ and "Load" the vecs.tsv file under "Vectors" and meta.tsv file under "Metadata".
